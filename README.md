# Hybrid-Malware-Scanner

The malicious script detector is a tool designed to detect potentially harmful scripts within directories. It recursively scans files, excluding certain file types that are unlikely to contain malware. It utilizes lists of keywords commonly associated with malicious activities such as keyloggers, reverse shells, DoS attacks, ransomware, and packet sniffers. These keywords are categorized by programming language (Python, C#, C, Java) and are sourced from known malware repositories.
The program also has a function for detecting encrypted files within a directory(see Figures 11.1-11.3). The encrypted files could be a sign of ransomware. The function “Is_File_Encrypted” is responsible for determining if a file is encrypted. It utilizes various methods to detect encryption, including checking file extensions commonly associated with encrypted files and analysing file signatures.
The last part of the signature detection incorporated into the live process monitoring function is for data theft which checks for signs of data/files being moved, deleted, created, or modified(see Figures 17.1 and 17.2). It can also detect files that have been copied. These are focused on the directory path “C:\Users\ (current user) \OneDrive\Documents”. This was chosen due to this being the main folder path for a user’s files so the most likely to be targeted. It utilizes the FileSystemEventHandler class from the watchdog library to handle file system events such as file creation, deletion, modification, and movement.
